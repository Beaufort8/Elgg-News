******* Elgg News Plugin *******

Free Elgg plugin for posting news and announcements by administrators.

This plugin offers admins the options:
1. Post news items
2. Add other Elgg entities as news items

As an example for 2nd case, if there is blog post by any user, administrator can add this as news post. So it will be displayed in list of news but if users click on this item, will redirected to original blog post. The same action could apply to any post like pages, bookmarks, videos etc.
